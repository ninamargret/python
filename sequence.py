#Design an algorithm that generates the first n numbers in the following sequence:; 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ___, ___, ___, …

#Make sure that you write up the algorithm before starting to code.
#Then implement the algorithm in Python. Put your algorihmic description as a comment in the program file.
 
#During the design of your algorithm and your implementation, you should use git:
#Write the text of your algorithm in a file called sequence.py
#Inspect the result of git status
#Use git add . to move changes to the staging area.
#Commit your changes with git commit -m “Algorithm written for sequence”
#Then start implementing your algorithm
#During your implementation, make sure you do git status, git add, and git commit regularily.
#You can see a log of all your commits with git log.
#When you have finished your implementation:
#Push your changes to the remote repo with: git push
#Inspect your commits on github
